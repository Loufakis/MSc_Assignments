# VAW (Violence Against Women) Dataset Analysis
This is an MSc assignment in Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the analysis of the VAW (Violence Against Women) dataset. The dataset was collected from the Pacific Data Hub (https://stats.pacificdata.org/vis?fs[0]=Topic%2C0%7CSocial%23SOC%23&pg=0&fc=Topic&df[ds]=SPC2&df[id]=DF_VAW&df[ag]=SPC&df[vs]=1.0) and contains information about traumatic experiences faced by women.

The goal of the assignment is to clean, encode, preprocess the data and then train various machine learning models to predict the outcome class, which refers to the outcome that the traumatic experience had on the woman's life/health.

Some of the main features used in the analysis include:

- Age at which the woman experienced the traumatic experience
- Relationship she had with the person who caused the violence
- Type of violence experienced
- Whether there was a person who helped her with the experience

It is important to note that the data was in a very poor condition and limited information could be gained from it. As a result, the accuracy of the prediction models is expected to be low.
